# hotel-details

A mockup of a hotel details page, for mobile use only (iPhone and Android), utilizing only HTML5 and CSS3. No javascript. 

## To View
Download all files/structure and open the file "hotel-details.html" in a browser. From a mobile phone, will need to include within an application utilizing node.js and serve from there. From a desktop, can use Safari or Chrome mobile UI converters to view. The styling has been set to optimize at a width of around 365px to 400px and up. 

I did not use any CSS preprocessors, javascript libraries or frameworks, and no media queries. Just CSS3 and HTML5.
